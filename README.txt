Practicing creating a git repository, this is my first ever.
Using a simple Vignere Cipher program I wrote while doing
an intro cryptography class. Not really sure what I am 
doing, but will add every file in my local project folder.

Updating on GitHub...

Have removed "venv" directory because it's redundant
(probably should have used .gitignore)

Updating from command line local git
